Hello! Welcome to my personal webpage.

Currently, I am a second-year master's student at the University of Amsterdam.

I have ~3 years of industry machine learning experience. My research works were published in venues like ECCV, AAAI, ICLR, and ReScience.
I have broad research interests in Machine Learning including Natural Language Processing, Geometric Deep Learning, Graph Neural Networks, and Generative Models.

I am looking for full-time opportunities starting in Fall 2023.
